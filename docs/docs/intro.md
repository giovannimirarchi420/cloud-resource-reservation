# Cloud Resource Reservation System Overview

Welcome to the **Cloud Resource Reservation System** - a comprehensive platform designed to automate and manage cloud resource reservations with intelligent webhook integration.

## System Architecture

The Cloud Resource Reservation System is built using a modern microservices architecture with the following key components:

### Core Services

- **üñ•Ô∏è reservation-fe**: React-based frontend application providing an intuitive user interface
- **üîå reservation-be**: Backend service handling business logic, APIs, and database operations
- **‚ö° reservation-event-processor**: Event-driven microservice for asynchronous processing
- **üîë Keycloak**: Authentication and authorization service
- **üóÑÔ∏è PostgreSQL**: Database for persistent data storage

### Infrastructure Components

- **üê≥ Docker & Docker Compose**: Containerization and local development environment
- **‚ò∏Ô∏è prognose-helm-chart**: Kubernetes deployment using Helm charts
- **üîó Webhook System**: Extensible webhook framework for resource integration

## How Components Interact

    A[Frontend UI] --> B[Backend API]
    B --> C[Database]
    B --> D[Event Processor]
    D --> E[Webhook System]
    E --> F[External Resources]
    G[Keycloak] --> A
    G --> B
```

1. **User Interaction**: Users interact with the React frontend to create reservations and configure resources
2. **API Layer**: The backend provides RESTful APIs secured with Keycloak authentication
3. **Event Processing**: Asynchronous events are processed by the event processor microservice
4. **Webhook Integration**: Custom webhooks enable integration with external resource providers
5. **Data Persistence**: All data is stored in PostgreSQL with proper transaction management

## Key Features

### üéØ Resource Management
- Create and manage cloud resource reservations
- Track resource availability and usage
- Automated resource lifecycle management

### üîó Webhook Integration
- Extensible webhook framework for custom integrations
- Python-based webhook examples (like `polito-switch-port-webhook`)
- Real-time event processing and notifications

### üîê Security & Authentication
- Keycloak-based authentication and authorization
- Role-based access control (RBAC)
- Secure API endpoints with JWT tokens

### üöÄ Deployment & Scalability
- Docker containerization for consistent deployments
- Kubernetes support with Helm charts
- Microservices architecture for horizontal scaling
